## Description

Calendar project created with React with TypesScript using recooil for state management and [Kalend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kalend) to simplify the logic behind the calendar. When finishing the project, I made a point of implementing local storage to make it minimally functional in case anyone wanted to use it. In the future I intend to leave renponsive and create the mobile.

## Tools

- 📆 kalend - API to help with Calendar implementation, simplifying visibility of events into days, weeks, months or calendar, dragging and dropping events and is compatible with mobile devices.
- 🗓️ React with TypeScript
- 📅 recoil - to state management.
